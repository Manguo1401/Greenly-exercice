# Steps for the exercise 

## Intall Typescript for types

- Install typescript to ensure type security 

## Create all jest unit tests

- Check with Jest that all the cases given in the exercise are ok and secure code modification when the main method will be refactored

## Refactor method

- The store class is a if/else mess. It needs to be split into comprehensible small methods or functions (Keep It Simple Stupid)

## Add new tests and comply to them by integrating the new code

- Add new tests to prepare for the evolutions asked by the exercise
- Add the evolutions in the code
